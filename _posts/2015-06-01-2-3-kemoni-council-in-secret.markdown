Shuk and Napik sat on a table amidst drunken inn customers. Napik swirled the beer in her mug, listening.

"Broft has finally lost his mind," whispered Shuk. "Have you seen how he walks around dazed? He's just chasing his tail all day long..."

He rubbed his scaly neck and turned to watch the other tables. The sounds of the inn kept the discussion private. But some people can hear better than others...

"He's always been like that, actually," said Napik.

She leaned her elbows on the table, and her furry hand covered her mouth. Her thumb stroked the protruding tusk.

Shuk turned his slitted pupils on her. "The buffalo herds are late again and all he cares about is the newest Ascension. We need those people here, working the land, not escorting some girl."

"Shhh... keep your voice down," she said. "But on that we agree. He's poisoning Qoff's mind."

A person in a black robe walked between the inn's society. He had a hood over his head. He walked towards their table and pulled a chair to sit.

Shuk turned to look. He blinked a few times -- with both inner and outer eyelids. Beneath the hood, he saw shaggy gray fur.

"Lowf? Is that you?" he said.

Napik stood up and her snout flared.

"What's the meaning of this?" she said. "You are not welcome here." He'd been eavesdropping, damn his pointy canine ears. Napik folded her arms and stared down.

Lowf knew it wasn't only because of his conspicuous fur color.

"You often side against us," she said. "What reason do you have now?"

Lowf peeked up from under the hood, his eyes becoming visible. He looked from Shuk to Napik.

"Lanmia was Juri's apprentice," he said. "I will not have her sacrificed to the sterile gods."

Napik's frown eased and she sat down, her arms still folded. Lowf turned to Shuk.

"There are others like me," he said, "who have their reasons, who are sick of this."

Shuk nodded and they shook hands, scales to fur.

"It can be done," said Lowf. "And it will be."

"For the good of the people," said Shuk.

Lowf smiled. "And for our other reasons," he said.

Shuk turned to Napik to resume the discussion.

"Napik, who's with us?" he said. Napik started listing names. Fiks, Rohj, Plob...

Lowf tuned out the voices of their discussion. He turned away to watch the crowd. The innkeeper polished a tankard with a cloth.

His eyes blanked as his mind drifted to distant memories. Juri had stood polishing behind that same counter. She smiled, and her buck teeth protruded slightly.

"They're calling you the lone Lowf," she had said.

A heavy thud hit the counter as Lowf set the wrapped game meat.

"Would 'they' be referring to the fat drunkards, perchance?" he said.

"They need their breaks, so let them have one," she said. She winked. "Or two. And there's more than just spirits, you know. There are softs, vigors, vivids..."

"What sort of madness do you have in that stuff?" he said.

She set the tankard down and walked closer. She leaned over the counter to whisper.

"Maybe someday I'll make you that special soft and vigor mix, and you'll find out."

She wiggled her eyebrows. Lowf looked at her ears. They were tall, and they folded slightly near the top. He noticed -- for the first time -- how soft they seemed.

She took the wrapped meat from between them.

"I swear, Lowf, by my bushy fluffy tail: for someone so helpful, you are a bit dense," she said. "So stop being blind and start seeing the good in other people."
