Knight.Loar5x awoke with a stiff neck. _Where did that memory come from?_ he thought. _Its edges are fuzzy, like an erased painting._

He was thirsty: the air scratched his throat when he inhaled. He was hungry: his stomach chewed itself, ripping itself unto itself.

He scavenged the other bags for food. He chewed some bread: it tasted like fertile soil. He bit an apple and rolled it on his tongue: it tasted like bitter leaves. He jumped back to his own bag. He locked his lips on a bottle and sucked a Satiety Potion. It soothed his throat and eased his stomach.

He walked around salvaging the equipment he saw. He felt queasy after a while. He reached down to pick up a knife and threw up the potion he'd drunk. It seemed his twisted body can not be tricked. _But what does it want?_

The trees rustled in the wind, and a light breeze caressed his cheek. The breeze carried a marvelous odor. He sniffed it and his nose led him to one of the bodies. He leaned closer to smell. It wasn't the dirt, nor the maggots, nor the fabric. _What am I smelling?_

He picked up a hand armored within a glove, preserved from the elements. He undressed the fingers one at a time. He gazed at it with wide eyes, focusing on the teeny mosaic patterns of the skin. It felt soft in his palm. He took a deep whiff and his mouth salivated. He opened his mouth over it and stopped himself when he noticed the captain's ring. _What am I doing? Am I really going to ignore my..._ he thought, and his mind blanked as the smell filled his nostrils again.

_What was I thinking about?_ he thought. He blinked at the hand a few times. Yes, I forgot to wash it. He poured a Cleansing Potion over it and waved it around to dry.

He bit the wrist, struggling to get his teeth in. The soapy potion taste was still there, but he munched anyway.

After a few bites he regained his senses. He looked at the dry blood on his hands and the bodies around him. He recalled the ambush scene and only felt a hazy a realization of what he had become.

His heavy stomach lulled his mind and flooded him with sleepy contentment. _Power, _he thought. He licked his lips and smiled. He rummaged through the other items. Between the blood and puke, there remained a single plain robe to wear. The thick wool itched his skin.

He stopped himself from grabbing the bloodied weapons. Let the dead keep their toys_,_ he thought. _I'm beyond this._

He picked up potions and miscellaneous wares to sell, and he headed towards the nearest village. _This will be terribly productive._
