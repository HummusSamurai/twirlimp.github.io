**Kemoni Council**

_"The Chosen One is often the one who chose himself." -- Hrag the Wise._

The Kemoni council was seated in a circle around a wooden table. Council member Napik waved a furry fist in the air.

"My great-grandfather helped build these walls with his bare paws!" she said. Her protruding tusks moved about as she spoke.

Broft tapped his feline claws on the table, scratching the wood before him. His tail wagged behind.

"_My_ great-grandmother," he said, "she cleansed this village from the evil spirits. Everyone was writhing in their sweaty cots. They moaned and tore at their fur, and she cured them all. If it wasn't for her, there would be no Kemoni Village where we stand. We deserve this honor..."

Shuk was leaning on the table, his head propped up by his green scaly hand.

"Get your whiskers out of the clouds, Broft, an' stop digging up old stories," said Shuk, his facial scales grimacing. "Only last week, my family hunted down an entire herd of buffaloes..."

Qoff looked back and forth between Broft and Shuk. They sat at opposite ends; he observed from the council's head seat. _This is escalating too fast,_ he thought. _It could be the ladybug that caused the Buffalo stampede._

Napik snarled. "And my family cut them up!" she said.

"Enough!" said Qoff.

He smashed his fists on the table and stood up. His pointy bovine horns rose high. His snout flared.

"Enough with your bickering!" he said. "This is not a matter of honor. This is a holy task: it needs holy guidance."

Everyone shut up to watch him. He could almost see the imaginary faction lines.

"We'll seek the Wise One of Fnord," he said. "He will guide us away from Doubt and Temptation and into higher justice. Was he not the one we turned to when Napik's son claimed Shuk's grand-daughter wasn't his own, and thus he can..."

Napik coughed loudly to interrupt.

"Yes, yes, we all remember. Let the Wise One guide us," she said.

Qoff remained seated and the council stood up to leave. Fur and flowing garments surrounded him. He let out a pent-up breath. The organic wall enclosed him. _What have I just done?_
