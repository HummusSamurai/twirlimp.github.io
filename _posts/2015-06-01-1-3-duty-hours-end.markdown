XIII. Conclusions and Implications

**. . .**

However, some colleagues might argue that digital addiction had not been explicitly accounted for and thus tainted the implication with inaccurate premises. This is due to the fact that it was -- and still is -- _not possible to find a large enough study sample that spends more than two to four hours outside virtu gear._Â (Burns, 2106).

The negative correlation thus quantitatively attained implies that, for all the popularity that the recent "A Play Place is a Fake Face" pop counter-culture movement has had, _people across the nation are entirely unperturbed, and still average 96.74% of their free time* logged into their escape of choice _(Jenkins, 2108).

However, if one accounts for the tighter employee firing laws that reduced frictional unemployment (Smith, 2105) and subsequently free time, this indicates that, _caeteris paribus, _there is actually an increase in lay acceptance instead of the apparent plateau. _Hence there is a definite convergence of socionormal trends towards comprehensive, nationwide virtual immersion_, to culminate within the next century according to the psychohistory model derived from Tzu's third law (2093).

He sucked on the ambrosial lozenge, waiting.
