The sparkle of a diamond knife;
The glow of poisoned honey;
The blaze of a rose on fire;
The laughÂ of a bloodied bunny.

The scream of velvet perfume;
The smell of bloodied wine;
The touch of lost kittens;
The sigh of watered pine.

The cloud of crimson berry;
The tears of stars at night;
The smile of dried flowers;
The ache of sunset light.

I have failed to express
the clarity of her caress.
