The tour group stood behind a glass wall. A white table appeared on the other side. Robotic arms hoisted a furry humanoid body onto it.

"The specimens are partially vivisected -- nothing permanently disabling of course," said the guide, "and after some probing and enhancement insertions, they're sent back to the wilds.

"But some respond to the treatment better than others. Rank S specimens have undergone significant upgrades, and they cause noticeable changes at returning to their native habitat, on the social level at least.

"One time a specimen became the alpha male and led the pack to fight other herds. Boy what a study that made!" said the guide.

CharlieVING observed the body being held in place with cold robo-appendages. He felt the animals wouldn't appreciate this. Does this really enhance the specimen's life?_ Hadn't they been living just fine before?_

The specimen had a beak and webbed paws. Brown fur covered its torso and its tail. Sharp serrated teeth lined its mouth.

"How many times has this specimen been worked on?" asked MichealBUNJ. "It looks very messy."

"This is the first time, actually," said the guide.

MichealBUNJ made a confused look. Sc1enti5t_Guide24 laughed.

"Yes, they're weird ones, the ones in the platypus genus," said the guide.

A robotic arm moved towards the table. Shiny and smooth, it had several joints for twisting. The students' eyes followed the metallic shape. Brown goo was sprayed on the table. The tied specimen squirmed in the thick goo, but its movement slowed as the anesthesia goo paralyzed it.

The machines grabbed sharp utensils, and the students 'oohed' and 'aahed.' The specimen's eyes darted about -- the only part it could move. Its wild eyes traced the movement of the approaching tools.

"The current experiment involves inserting a standard cyberbionic device", said the tour guide. "If successful, it should provide a significant sensory and intellectual improvement."

Pointy tools poked the convulsing body. The sound was muted out, realized CharlieVING. The mechanical arms poked in unison, poking again and again; and the pattern dulled him into a memory. He was KickerClerk69U.

He'd been poured over a tome in the Transcription Archives. It had thick sheets, their color aged and their edges worn. His eyes squinted as he read the faded script, cursive and tiny.

He scratched his nose to tickle the dust smell. He had an empty scroll beside the tome. He grabbed a feather quill, dipped it in an inkwell, and brought it down on the scroll.

His boss stood on a chair, hanging a Protective Scroll (Rare Quality lvl 4) on the wall.

A knock sounded on the room's door. His boss FoamlessVoyd43 descended to the floor.

More knocking. "Open up, we have a message from His Majesty," said one voice.

FoamlessVoyd43 opened the door. He smiled at the large man filling the door frame.

"Welcome to my humble magic scroll shop," he said.

The men walked in, all armed and official. In the corner, KickerClerk69U looked from one soldier to the other, unnoticed for now. His fear paralyzed him in place.

The head soldier walked in and spoke. "His majesty has deigned to honor you with an invitation to join his council," he said. "The realm's justice covets your wisdom and skill."

FoamlessVoyd43 bent to sit on a chair, and he grunted at his rusted old body.

"Once upon a time," he said, "there was a turtle splashing in the mud. It was captured for a royal sacrifice, and then hung in the king's personal chamber.

"Now tell me, dear gentlemen, don't you suppose that, despite the grace bestowed upon it, the turtle might've preferred to splash in the mud?"

The captain frowned beneath his helmet. The fat soldier behind him started speaking. The fatty flesh on his neck jiggled.

"It would've chosen the mud, of course," he said.

"Then go," said FoamlessVoyd43. "Leave me to my mud splashing."

Back in the lab tour, the robotic arms stopped poking. The furry body lay still -- no more convulsing. Its colors were alone in the gray room.

_There has to be a better way to understand, _thought CharlieVING. _Without pain, without doubt._
