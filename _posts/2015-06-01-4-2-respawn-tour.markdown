The door of the classbus opened, and the pupils descended one at a time. They walked into a spacious lobby.

"Welcome to the educational instance of the Applied Genetics Department," said Sc1enti5t_Guide24. "Our section is an integral part of Central Operations."

They followed him through the white corridors. The bare walls had a few ad posters. Floating eyes passed by occasionally.

"After the Fusionergy Revolution of twenty one," said Sc1enti5t_Guide24, "Central Ai-Eye is turning its attention towards other issues, now that world poverty is handled by Material Transmutation. We can generate enough to create abundant resources.

"It's not magic, for it requires tons of energy, but Cosmic Entropy is still far away. So what is there left to do, now that humans have practically transcended scarcity?" asked the guide.

CharlieVING raised his hand. He always knows lots of stuff, thought MinaPEF, so he's probably a clerk scribe in all of his play places_. _

She snickered._ The Random-Birth Generator really does hate him._

"Central AI wanted to make a better world model to increase efficiency, of course," said CharlieVING.

_Those damned nerdy glasses_, thought MinaPEF_._ He probably hunches over large dusty books. _I will be learning cool fire magic, so poo him._

"Exactly! Efficiency," said the guide.

The teacher raised her hand.

"Yes, Miss NatriFEL," said the guide.

She came closer to whisper. "Perhaps you can focus more on what this facility does," she said. "The tour is a bit short for preliminaries." And when the tour is done, she'll return to her place place -- the Cypor Bunk.

"Certainly, certainly, yes. I was just getting to that," he said.

She walked back to the kids. He cleared his throat.

"We study the organic genome here, to adapt mammalian bodies to all sorts of environmental changes," he said. "There's fur for cosmic freezing, gills for class C world floods, whiskers for complete lunar eclipses... and we usually mix and match, to see what useful features we can come up with."

Sc1enti5t_Guide24 walked to a gigantic room, and the young persons followed. A three-dimensional map model covered the entire floor.

"The confinement sector is engineered to provide an environment that perfectly emulates primeval living conditions," he said.

He pointed at different areas with different colors.

"These are large bodies of water, and these are elevated terrestrial grounds..." he said.

"Seas and mountains! Lots of play places have those," said EliPON.

"Almost: they were modeled after the same formations that covered the planet in antiquity," said the guide, then turned back to the map. "Anyway what happens is that we lower a few platforms every now and then, add some delicious food, some sleeping gas, and wham! We trap one!

"But considering their cohesive social groups, their collective reward mechanism is curiously not well-developed enough to realize that taking the bait equals losing a person. See, poor creatures from all the sectors always come back for more tempting bait."

He turns to look at a chart on the wall. He slides a finger through the list and then taps one of the entries: 'Miscellaneous specimen; Stable cellular maturity.'

"Aha! We have a scheduled inspection," he said. "You'll get to see the process in action. We stream a visual feed of the physical laboratories, where the robots perform the remotely-allocated tasks."
