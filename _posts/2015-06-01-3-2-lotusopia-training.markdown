"It's not working," said Really_Pro65 (level 7).

An unlit campfire stood before him. Hours had passed but the trees have not changed, the birds chirped the same tune. He'd been trying the skill moves over and over, but the damned sticks won't even start a small flame.

He sighed. _This magic skill has to work, _he thought. _Then, soon... the Sharp Inferno. _

"It's working. I can sense it," said Sage_Hermit37 (level 30), seated on a log, holding a magic scroll.

"Sense it?" said Really_Pro65. This man is the strongest wizard he's ever seen, but he's not teaching fast enough.

"The magic flow, using Magic Perception, can be traced through the XP tendrils of..." He coughed. "Just forget it. Keep practicing and you'll get there when the miss rate improves."

The old man looked back down at the magic scroll. His stomach rumbled. Dizziness made the symbols dance. _Need to eat flesh... Get the money, buy some at butcher..._

"Isn't there a way to make this go faster?" said Really_Pro65. "Some Fire Magick potion or something?"

Sage_Hermit37 looked up to smile at the boy, the corners of his eyes crinkling with amusement.

"You're a bit young to drink a Fire Magic potion, but if you're that interested, I have a marvelously dry book about the philosophy of Feireh Majii."

He reached into his leather satchel and took out a thick, ragged tome. He held an empty palm above it. A second copy materialized beside it. He held it out with a shaking hand.

"Enjoy the poems of Guru Laheema of the Salamander guild. His flames are even sharper than mine."

Really_Pro65 grabbed the book and drifted into a fantasy. Flaming logs took the place of campfire sticks. He would stand with a puffed chest in front of the hearth, and LaryaBehl632 (level 7) would clap and laugh. He would look into her green eyes and grin. _"We just saved ourselves some time preparing the hearth-fire",_ he would say._ "Let's explore a Spring Pixie forest before it's time to cook the stew." _

Thanks to her Traditional Domestic training, LaryaBehl632 is a master Forest Gatherer -- a very useful skill. Her Prettiness level is also high, which boosts his Social-Interaction XP gain.

He stared at the tome copy. _This magic has to work,_ he thought. He opened the book, and two worn yellow pages flew out.

One of them said 'the world manifests in a lick of flame'.

"Don't worry about it," said Sage_Hermit37. "That's why I made a copy. Now, off you go."

Really_Pro65 re-stood in front of the sticks. He took a deep breath, bent his knees, and lifted his arms up. He tried to turn to the side: he lost his balance and wobbled around on one leg.

"Keep going, you're getting there. The energy paths just need some more aligning," said Sage_Hermit37.

Really_Pro65 tried again to do the moves for the magic skill. His arms were heavy, his legs not firm. His breath was not even. His mind was clouded. _Soft, smooth, sleep..._

"Stop, stop, that's enough," said Sage_Hermit37. "Your system isn't used to juggling raw channels. At this rate you'll get Residual Coma on your first day."

Really_Pro65 sat down, panting. Sage_Hermit37 poured water from a gourd into the boy's open mouth.

"Remember to keep the fire from burning you, kid," he said faintly.

Really_Pro65 closed his eyes. Sage_Hermit37 dragged him over to the donkey, waving its tail. He put the boy atop it and tugged the donkey from the reins. It trotted slowly, chewing on grass. They moved away from the small camp and into some bushes. The bushes rustled and tugged at their clothes.

On the other side was a narrow dirt trail between trees and grass. They followed it towards the nearest cross roads. A sign pointed to the nearest village.
