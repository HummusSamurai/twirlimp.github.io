NiteBIL sipped some coffee. _Such an archaic document..._

He stared at the warm mug in his hands. _Even before the launch of the Global Nutrient IV system,_ he thought, when people still physically ingested their meals. When people actually left their Pods... _and moved their physical limbs_...

A voice boomed from everywhere and engulfed NiteBIL. "This virtual coffee break was sponsored by..." it said.

NiteBIL chugged down the remaining brown liquid in his cup. _So soon?_

"Are you bored of virtu work and virtu classes? Generic play places not cutting it out anymore? You deserve better!"

The table disappeared and so did the cup in his hand. Black space was everywhere. A small box appeared near the standing NiteBIL. 'Pay $5 to Skip Ad,' it suggested.

Gigantic letters smashed onto an invisible wall.
"Lotusopia!" said the voice.

Smaller letters flew underneath.
"The play place that YOU. WILL. LOVE."

_Okay_, he thought, _this is not so bad. I know this one..._

Forest replaced the darkness. A brown bear walked on green grass, with intricate symbols  etched on his fur. Teeny humanoid creatures floated around NiteBIL and the rustling tree branches. _This must be the Vacuous Pixie Garden_, he thought. _I should visit more often; this bear would loot for lots of meat._

Colors faded out; endless snow covered the ground. Grey wolves hovered around a carcass. Their ears perked up and they turned. They snarled at NiteBIL; their eyes and teeth were crimson. He flinched by force of habit. He remembered their bite on his arm. _Still think it's worth it -- for the pelt if not the Experience Points._

Letters smashed on an invisible wall above the wolves' heads.
"Original and dynamic hyper-realistic environments to explore and tame!"

The white became gold; wooden planks formed a floor underneath NiteBIL's feet. Candles lined the wall; yellow lights flickered. A crowd socialized over a distant chess table. A woman -- low neckline -- leaned forward on a nearby table; she gazed at NiteBIL. She bit her lip and winked. NiteBIL swallowed.

Letters smashed under her bosom.
"Engaging, hyper-realistic social interactions!"

Two swords clanged against each other. Two young men sparred in a yard. An archer shot an arrow at a straw sack. Spheres of fire and water smashed between two dancing wizards.

_The Rogues of the Defiant Guild? I thought they'd all been exterminated._ Shiny dust rained on NiteBIL. He sneezed.

Glass test tubes covered a table. A man mixed fluids; purple smoke puffed up in his face. He gulped the mixture and his form faded to invisibility -- _I have to try the alchemy skill_, thought NiteBIL -- to reveal a large black cauldron bubbling over a fire.

A chef in an apron threw vegetables inside the cauldron. He chopped with inhuman speed. Letters smashed on the wall above the chef's cap.
"A deep and comprehensive hyper-realistic system of skills to master!"

The space was black again. Bubbles floated around, encapsulating living worlds inside.
"LOTUSOPIA! The play place that YOU. WILL. LOVE."

One bubble had a copper dragon flying over a desert. A person rode on him, adorned in jewelry. Another bubble had a waitress serving beer. She was bitten in the neck. Another had a man dancing rigidly, sparring against the air in fluid moves. The ground cracked when he stomps.

"LOTUSOPIA! Live. Grow. Thrive."

The bubbles faded away; NiteBIL was back in a small office. An eye floated above him, monitoring his movements. Images of treasures and pleasures lingered in his mind. _My Knight.Loar5x can beat all of them. A few more Duty Hours to return..._

He flipped through papers and sorted. _Just this one more pile..._

A knock sounded on the office door and it creaked open. A young man came in, wearing a cap. He smiled and saluted.

"Good duty hours sir!" said the young man.

He placed a mail parcel. NiteBIL sighed at the new work load.

"When do you go play place, RonaldFEL?" said NiteBIL. "I saw you in my last three Duty Sessions."

RonaldFEL took two pills from his pocket and jiggled them in his palm.

"I save my Logens so I'd have longer sessions," he said. "I have characters in three play places; and I like to visit them all without Duty interruptions."

NiteBIL widened his eyes. "That's impressive," he said. "Though I personally need my play placing breaks."

RonaldFEL nodded and turned to go outside. His mail bag hit the door on the way out. NiteBIL looked down at the current paper stack.



* * *



NiteBIL lowered the last piece of paper onto the desk. His tight frown relaxed. _Finally -- the desk is empty. _He clicked the paper stack, it shrunk, and he threw it in the drawer.

The chutes above him clattered and clunked as something moved inside, bumping around. A translucent egg slid out from an opening by his desk. He cracked it open and a pill fell out.

He directly popped it in his mouth. _A Logen, _he thought. He reclined back on the chair and closed his eyes. _Finally -- my mind will be cleared._

He sucked on the ambrosial lozenge, waiting.
