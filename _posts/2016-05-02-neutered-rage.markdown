_For best results, play a [flute in the background](https://youtu.be/dz9eCLiTvDc?t=20m49s)._

raindrops slide down as
iÂ stand behind the glass
and my cold paw can't touch them

my sigh is not seen
and storm light numbs me
as the grey thunder flinches

i stare with fat eyes
at the yawn outside
for i am a neutered cat

i get ready meals
but they always lack
the taste of birdy tears

my lone warmth is fire
we are dead inside
we ache and yearn for release

the house is the cage
and fat fuels the rage
of a neutered household cat
