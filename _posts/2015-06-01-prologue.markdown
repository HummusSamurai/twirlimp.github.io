To tell the story of the Eye Rebellion, one must start from the Kems' Exodus.
The Exodus is considered the first active step that Central Ai-Eye took to quell what would later become known as the Eye Rebellion.

The following scenes have been chosen and compiled by the causal-linker.

Knight.Loar5x found himself standing in a white room. He rubbed his throat and swallowed. It was smooth, healed. The sharp blade had tickled as it cut across, and warm liquid had flowed down in streams.

His short bow (level 8) was still in his hand, the quiver empty on his back. He looked up at the closed door in front of him, and he frowned. _I will be back for you_, he thought. _I swear it._

His body began sliding backwards. He tried to walk forward but he merely marched in his place. _Damn, but what if I'm too late?_






A floating Eye hurtled towards him as he pushed forward. It banged his head and he flew backwards into an open door. "Historical Archives" was written above it.
