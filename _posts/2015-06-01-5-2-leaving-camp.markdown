_These feet were not meant for long hikes,_ thought Shuk. He sat on a log in a dark secluded corner, away from the campfire. He rubbed the soles of his feet, and his fingers stroked the web between his toes. His white protruding teeth contrasted with his dark scales.

Around the campfire, food was distributed from bags. Meat was pierced into twigs to roast over fire. The fire crackled, bordered by stones and ash. _Soon, _thought Shuk,_ under the night's cover, our seizure will begin._

Shuk turned at the sound of another box opening. He watched Dibb open another casket of berries, and smelt the whiff of sour sweetness.

Siff munched on an apple as he watched Dibb.

"Stop distributing to others and start eating," said Siff. "There are both meats and plants."

"My mother always told me to wait for other people to pick first, then pick the type with more left over," said Dibb.

"How about, meanwhile, you eat a piece from each?" said Siff.

Dibb frowned and gazed at a corner, mentally calculating. He shrugged, sat next to Siff, and chomped into an apple. His black claws sank into it.

"Easy there, it's going to pop," said Siff.

Siff fell back and laughed, and his quills pierced into the bushes behind. Dibb laughed too, his open maw leaking wet goo chunks.

Siff remembered his wife as she fed their son gooey food. Their son Hedj would look up, his quills stuck in the wrapping cloth. He would open his mouth to receive the half-chewed food.

Siff had had a bowl of beetle stew before him. Black beetles and red ladybugs swam in the yellow liquid. Siff poked one of the insects, then frowned and poked his wife.

"Nima why aren't the lady bugs twitching?" he said. Neither the antennas, nor the feet. He pinched one bug, and he sniffed it with his snout.

"Are they roasted?" he asked.

The baby was cooing as his mother fed him. His mouth leaked food, and his mother used a finger to swipe it back between his lips.

"Well I was trying to mix in some soil worms for a change," she said, "but I kinda dropped the bugs there as well.

"And in my defense, it _is_ tasty..."

She raised an eyebrow and nodded towards the bowl. He kept his eyes on her as he took a mouthful of bug. He closed his eyes and his eyelids quivered. The salty nut taste was there. He savored the mouthful till he sucked all its juice.

Then the bugs crunched as he chewed. He savored the soft juiciness inside the squished beetle, and the chewy gumminess of the cooked worm.

His cheeks bulged as he chewed, but he tried to speak anyway.

"I'z goo," he had said.

She smiled. "Yes it is, isn't it?" she said. "Wait till the effect of the Vigor worm kicks in."

She winked. He swallowed.

The food image brought him back to the present, reminded him of his hunger. He looked down at the grub in his bowl. Their white bodies squirmed, and the flickering firelight danced in the bowl with them.

Siff looked up at the campfire. Several people had crowded before it, covering parts of the scene. One person stood at the center, holding their attention with a story.

He swept his arms upwards.

"Up the sky pillars he'd went, lain on a celestial tent!" said the storyteller.

Siff imagined the story scene. _The hero floats on a bed of clouds, tall and broad-chested. _

The storyteller deepened his voice, his arms still lifted. "And all who witnessed the solemn bloom, none could believe his return would loom," he said.

Siff imagined the scene. _A crowd looks upward, saying their farewells, and turn their backs to go home._

"And when he's back, his wisdom was aglow. He had calm power, restrained yet aflow."

Siff imagined. _The hero avoids bloodshed, his serene face unperturbed. He dances with fluid grace between dozens of attackers._

_Yes, the chosen one would gift us wisdom, _Siff thought_, would aid us with skill and knowledge._

Siff looked back at the bowl in his hands. He started shoveling into his mouth, slurping and swallowing.

On the other side of the campfire, Lowf surveyed the scene. His erect ears twitched at the sound of Siff's slurping. His glowing eyes saw Shuk rubbing his green feet in the corner.

He stared at the dancing storyteller. _Damned demagogue,_ he thought. What right have they to force this Duty on Lanmia? Juri's legacy will not be mutilated like this._ I'll climb the sky pillars myself if I have to._

His sharp teeth sank into the meat he held, and his face contorted into a momentary grimace. Chewing, he imagined Juri's shelves of assorted bottles. _I wonder if Juri taught Lanmia the soft and vigor mix. _
