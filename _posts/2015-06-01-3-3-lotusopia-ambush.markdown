Sage_Hermit37 leaned on the stick as he walked. His eyes fluttered as he panted. _So hungry..._

A twang came from the trees. Sage_Hermit37 straightened up and forced his eyes open. An arrow flew past the donkey ears. It planted itself in the arm of Really_Pro65. His eyes flew open; his mouth uttered a shout. He lost consciousness and fell from the donkey.

Sage_Hermit37 caught him and set him on the ground, then turned towards the bandits coming out from the forestry. He stepped to the front, threw his arms in the air, twisted to the right and brought his arms down again. Mounds of earthen rock rose to form a protective tent around Really_Pro65. The bandits looked at each other. Both fire and earth? Not a common village mage.

They talked to each other, not in a language he knew, but he got the gist of their frenzy. Must be one of the new languages systematically introduced to create 'engaging hyper-realistic distinctions of social variety.'_ So much for diplomacy._ His stomach rumbled and contracted on itself, making him woozy.

The bandit took out another arrow from his quiver. It had a different glint on its head. A mage-killer. He knocked it, pulled back, and let go. By habit, Sage_Hermit37 lit it on fire, but it did not disintegrate. It continued flying, blazing, and planted itself in his stomach.

He flinched and stepped back. Can't use the elements anymore, but there are other ways... He continued walking towards them.Â  Another arrow. It went into his thigh. He grunted and limped forward, gritting his teeth. The archer looked at the tallest comrade -- probably the captain. These arrows aren't cheap, after all. The captain nodded. Selling the kid will cover the arrow costs.

Another arrow flew -- into the shoulder blades. Sage_Hermit37 swayed. The archer bandit lowered his bow. No more magic sticks. He moved his free hand to unsheathe his sword. Sage_Hermit37 jumped at him. He grabbed him by the shoulder and sank his teeth into the bandit's neck. Flesh.

He bit hard, his teeth pushing against the skin, and ripped a chunky mouthful. Glimmering red liquid poured out. He chewed and swallowed, his eyes rolling back in ecstasy. _Raw energy. Raw XP. Raw power._ He let the body fall to the ground. The other bandits grabbed their swords.

The arrows fell out from Sage_Hermit37's body. Smoke wisped up from his wounds as they closed. One of the bandits shivered, then dropped his sword and ran. He climbed atop a horse and rode away. Another bandit screamed and started running towards Sage_Hermit37.

Sage_Hermit37 held out his bloodied hand and flicked a small twist with his wrist. A chunk of rock rose from the ground to trip the bandit. The sword flew to the side and the bandit fell forward. Sage_Hermit37 smiled; the crooked yellow teeth glimmered red; his white beard dripped blood. The bandit fell into his arms, and teeth sank into the bandit's neck. The body flailed and twisted, but it was stuck in its place. Ready meals.

A few ghoulish bites later, all the bodies had dropped to the floor, some more marred than others. He opened Really_Pro65's earthen tent. He pulled out the arrow, and held his palm above the wound. Smoke came out, and Really_Pro65 moaned in his sleep. Sage_Hermit37 put two fingers on the wound. He pinched the skin, and as he pulled his hand away the wound closed and healed.

Sage_Hermit37 checked the pulses of the bandits. It's better for everyone that they die, he thought, instead of surviving such bites._ May their next life be more peaceful than the last._ He searched their bags and took the clean clothes, and changed Really_Pro65's clothes too.

Then they headed towards the village. They continued on the dirt trail. He licked his chops, which dislodged a morsel in his teeth, and returned the explosive flavor.

He imagined dragging the boy into the cabin, and looking up to see the worried mother's face. What will he say? "Oh, he's not resting from a traumatic coma; it's just an inner journey for the initiation rites."

He chuffed. _Meh, that'll do fine._

Their donkey trotted slowly with the boy strapped on its back. A lowly -- level 2 -- yellow lizard slithered into a hole. A level 10 beehive buzzed under a tree. That'll make some good profit, he thought._ Ha! One good meal and I'm a foolish youngling again. _

Sage_Hermit37 burped. _This really beats butcher meat._ His mind went back to the carnage scene and counted the bodies. _One, two, three... Oh, I forgot to finish off the archer in the corner._
