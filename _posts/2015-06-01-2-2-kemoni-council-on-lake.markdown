The council reassembled at the edge of the Lake. Qoff walked over to the water's edge and dipped his hoof deep into the water.

He raised his arms and intoned.

"We seek counsel with the Wise One," said Qoff.

Broft had a basket in his arms. He moved to stand beside Qoff, to assume his role as Translator. It has been his family's duty for generations. He would spread the advice of the spirits to help his people.

A blurry figure formed under the water surface.

"Oh Wise One," said Qoff, "Who will be the honored one to undertake the Sacred Voyage?"

Qoff removed his wet hoof from the water; the fur was pressed down but he dared not shake it off yet.

A head with shiny scales emerged from the water: it spoke quickly.

"The Divine lies within the Silence; the Silence is embraced by the Formless...," it said, running out of breath. The voice fell to a whisper near the end.

The head sank down to submerge its neck gills. A gasp was heard from underneath. Then the head went back up to continue.

"Their Union unlocks the Holy..."

The head plopped back down to breathe. And came up again, its scales gleaming in the sun.

"Only then will the Truth unfold," it said.

The oracle dove down head-first. The webbed feet hit the water and bubbles surfaced. Qoff nodded at Broft. Broft grabbed a fish from the basket.

"The Oracle of Fnord has spoken," said Qoff.

Broft threw the Trout of Trust over the lake, and it twisted in the air. The oracle leaped out of the water. His silvery scales glittered in the sunlight. He bit into the fish with sharp teeth. The water splashed when he fell.

One of the councilmen scrunched up his nose and muttered, "you'd think he'd cover up his private scales..."

Napik puffed. "Go on, Broft, what does the prophecy mean?"

Broft stared out at the lake. His striped orange fur jarred against the blue sky. _A great change is upon us, _he thought. _We must act, and we might have to cross the fine line._

He whispered softly. "I think..." he said, "the chosen one is Lanmia... She is the Silence."

Shuk grew annoyed with each pause. Each whisper prodded his irritation. He considered banging his thick head against a wall. _Is it even possible to be so disconnected? _thought Shuk._ Is he truly considering the needs of the people?_

"What about the rest of it? The Formless?" said Shuk. His serrated teeth protruded from his closed mouth.

"That is not for me to discover; the Silence will find her own path," said Broft. "I will meet with her this evening."
