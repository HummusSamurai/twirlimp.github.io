A story of three worlds linked together -- all of them set in the future.

The first world is the digital, virtual world where everyone lives detached from their physical bodies. The Hi-Tech future seems perfect, but what is happening secretly behind the scenes?

The second world is where the animal people live. They're genetic experiments locked in a realistic mega-cage. The Animal-People live confusing lives. What's the Chosen One? Seriously, what are they up to?

The third world is a virtual world where humans go in their free time. The fantasy world has frightening magic. Which character will overpower, and what are their purposes?

What story links all three?

To start reading, you can download [a book of all the chapters (up to date)](https://qotob.files.wordpress.com/2016/04/play-places.pdf).

The chapters always alternate from the first world to second to third and repeat.
